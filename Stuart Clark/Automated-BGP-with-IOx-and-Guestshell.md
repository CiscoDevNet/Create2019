# Automated BGP with IOx and Guestshell

This workshop does NOT offer a BYOD option.

Simply join at the time of the workshop, and use the provided Mac laptop.


## Objectives

Do you manage a plethora of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions?
If you have any BGP peering’s with a service provider (ISP) and/or peering at IXP (Internet exchange point), are you using BGP down to your servers? Event data is the recording of data at specific times triggered by a specific monitored state change. The state change could be a boolean value, such as an interface being up or down, or an exception triggered by exceeding a limit on a metric like a BGP peer exceeding its received prefix limit, which can have potentially unintended consequences to existing BGP sessions.

 How we can leverage automation to execute Python code directly on an end device as part of the application hosting capabilities provided by GuestShell. We will cover CLI, and the Python library specifically designed to be able to run CLI commands in Python. 


## Agenda

- To demonstrate IOS-XE’s Guestshell capabilities, we will executed a Python script that runs as an agent on the router to detect any BGP changes or packet loss / latency upstream
- Upon detection, the device will automatically decide what to do for us!
- We will look how as an admin you can be alerted with ChatOps – from warning to critical problem
- How this script can be modified to create service tickets for critical issues
- Tie this to event-driven telemetry, see how Peering event telemetry data is ideally sent when an event occurs on the device
