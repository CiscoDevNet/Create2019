# MAKING MAPS WITH XYZ 

**You can use one of the provided laptops or bring your own device (BYOD) as long as you have installed the pre-requisites below.**

Want to create a professional looking map with open source JavaScript libraries
but don’t know how? In this workshop we’ll create four beautiful maps – seismic
activity across the globe, air quality in Madrid, solar panels in Amsterdam,
and flight traffic from popular airports.

Build one just like these too or bring your own data and follow the tutorials.

Hope to see you at Create!

## Pre-Requisites

(1) You should sign up for a Free HERE Developer account by using this URL:

    https://developer.here.com/events/cisco-devnetcreate2019

(2) You can use one of the provided laptops or bring your own device.  Either way
is fine so long as you have installed:

- Standard browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)
- Node.js (v10) & npm
- Python 2.7, 3.x

(3) We will also install some additional libraries that you can download ahead of
time if you want to save time / network bandwidth.

    - `pip install csvkit`

    - `npm install -g @here/cli` and see [HERE CLI](https://www.here.xyz/cli/#install-here-cli)
       for more details on configuration

(4) Optional - identify data from open datasets or your own data that you'd
like to visualize on a map

For example:

    - California Open Data Portal - https://data.ca.gov/
    - San Jose - http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?NID=2384
    - San Francisco - https://datasf.org/opendata/
    - Data.gov - https://www.data.gov/open-gov/

GeoJSON or Shapefiles work best, but CSV is ok too.

## Objectives

The objective of this workshop is to:

- Show you process for creating maps
- Show you some workflows for cleaning / manipulating data
- Show you how to use multiple useful libraries to produce a map
- Help support creating your own map that is interesting
